Electron-Windows-Store: A CLI that takes the packaged output of your Electron app, then converts it into an AppX package. This allows you to submit your Electron app to the Windows Store :package:. You can also distribute your app as an `.appx` without using the Windows Store, allowing users to just double-click your `.appx` to automatically install it.

To install this command line tool, get it directly from npm:

```
npm install -g electron-windows-store
```

Then, configure your PowerShell:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

To turn an Electron app into an AppX package, run:

```
electron-windows-store --input-directory C:\myelectronapp  --output-directory C:\output\myelectronapp --package-version 1.0.0.0 --package-name myelectronapp
```

This tool supports two methods to create AppX packages: Either using manual file copy operations, or using Windows Containers. The first option requires only the [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk), while the second option also requires the [Desktop App Converter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-run-desktop-app-converter).

# Usage
Before running the Electron-Windows-Store CLI, let's make sure we have all the prerequisites in place. You will need:

 * Windows 10 with at least the Anniversary Update (if your Windows has been updated before 2018, you're good).
 * Windows 10 SDK from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
 * Node 8 or above (to check, run `node -v`)

## Package Your Electron Application
Package the application using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) (or something similar). Make sure to remove node_modules that you don't need in your final application.

The output should look roughly like this:
```
├── Ghost.exe
├── LICENSE
├── content_resources_200_percent.pak
├── node.dll
├── pdf.dll
├── resources
│   ├── app
│   └── atom.asar
├── snapshot_blob.bin
├── [... and more files]
```

## Convert with File Copying
**From an elevated PowerShell (run it "as Administrator")**, run `electron-windows-store` with the required parameters, passing both the input and output directories, the app's name and version. If you don't pass these parameters, we will simply ask you for them.

```
electron-windows-store --input-directory C:\myelectronapp  --output-directory C:\output\myelectronapp --package-version 1.0.0.0 --package-name myelectronapp
```

These are all options for the CLI:

```
  -h, --help                                 output usage information
  -V, --version                              output the version number
  -c, --container-virtualization             Create package using Windows Container virtualization
  -b, --windows-build                        Display Windows Build information
  -i, --input-directory <path>               Directory containing your application
  -o, --output-directory <path>              Output directory for the appx

  -d, --deploy <true|false>                  Should the app be deployed after creation?
  --identity-name <name>                     Name for identity
  --publisher <publisher>                    Publisher to use (example: CN=developmentca)
  --publisher-display-name <publisherDisplayName> Publisher display name to use
  --make-pri <true|false>                    Use makepri.exe (you don't need to unless you know you do)
  --windows-kit <windows-kit>                Path to the Windows Kit bin folder
  --dev-cert <dev-cert>                      Path to the developer certificate to use
  --cert-pass <cert-pass>                    Password to use when signing the application (only necessary if a p12 certication is used)
  --desktop-converter <desktop-converter>    Path to the desktop converter tools
  --expanded-base-image <base-image>         Path to the expanded base image
  --makeappx-params <params>                 Additional parameters for Make-AppXPackage (example: --makeappx-params "/l","/d")
  --signtool-params <params>                 Additional parameters for signtool.exe (example: --signtool-params "/l","/d")
  --create-config-params <params>            Additional parameters for makepri.exe "createconfig" (example: --create-config-params "/l","/d")')
  --create-pri-params <params>               Additional parameters for makepri.exe "new" (example: --create-pri-params "/l","/d")')
  --verbose <true|false>                     Enable debugging (similar to setting a DEBUG=electron-windows-store environment variable)
```

## Programmatic Usage
You can call this package directly. All options correspond to the CLI options and are equally optional. There is one exception: You can provide a `finalSay` function, which will be executed right before `makeappx.exe` is being called. This allows you to modify the output folder right before we turn it into a package.

```js
const convertToWindowsStore = require('electron-windows-store')

convertToWindowsStore({
   containerVirtualization: false,
   inputDirectory: 'C:\\input\\',
   outputDirectory: 'C:\\output\\',
   packageVersion: '1.0.0.0',
   packageName: 'Ghost',
   packageDisplayName: 'Ghost Desktop',
   packageDescription: 'Ghost for Desktops',
   packageExecutable: 'app/Ghost.exe',
   assets: 'C:\\assets\\',
   manifest: 'C:\\AppXManifest.xml',
   deploy: false,
   publisher: 'CN=developmentca',
   windowsKit: 'C:\\windowskit',
   devCert: 'C:\\devcert.pfx',
   certPass: 'abcd',
   desktopConverter: 'C:\\desktop-converter-tools',
   expandedBaseImage: 'C:\\base-image.wim',
   makeappxParams: ['/l'],
   signtoolParams: ['/p'],
   makePri: true,
   createConfigParams: ['/a'],
   createPriParams: ['/b'],
   protocol: "ghost-app",
   finalSay: function () {
     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve())
   }
})
```

## Convert with Container Virtualization
The Desktop App Converter is capable of running an installer and your app during conversion inside a Windows Container. This requires installation of the Desktop App Converter and has more advanced requirements.

:warning: The _vast majority_ of Electron apps should be packaged using "File Copying". Unless you know that you need your `appx` to be created using a Windows container, use the "File Copying" method described above.

:computer: Ensure that your computer is capable of running containers: You'll need a 64 bit (x64) processor, hardware-assisted virtualization and second Level Address Translation (SLAT). You will also need Windows 10 Enterprise Edition.

:bulb: Before running the CLI for the first time, you will have to setup the "Windows Desktop App Converter". This will take a few minutes, but don't worry - you only have to do this once. Download and the Desktop App Converter from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-run-desktop-app-converter). You will receive two files: `DesktopAppConverter.zip` and `BaseImage-14316.wim`.

1. Unzip `DesktopAppConverter.zip`. From an elevated PowerShell (opened with "run as Administrator"., ensure that your systems execution policy allows us to run everything we intended to run by calling `Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass`.
2. Then, run the installation of the Desktop App Converter, passing in the location of the Windows .ase Image (downloaded as `BaseImage-14316.wim`), by calling `.\DesktopAppConverter.ps1 -Setup -BaseImage .\BaseImage-14316.wim`.
3. If running the above command prompts you for a reboot, please restart your machine and run the above command again after a successful restart.

Then, run `electron-windows-store` with the `--container-virtualization` flag!

#### What is the CLI Doing?
Once executed, the tool goes to work: It accepts your Electron app as an input. Then, it archives your application as `app.zip`. Using an installer and a Windows Container, the tool creates an "expanded" AppX package - including the Windows Application Manifest (`AppXManifest.xml`) as well as the virtual file system and the virtual registry inside your output folder.

Once we have the expanded AppX files, the tool uses the Windows App Packager (`MakeAppx.exe`) to create a single-file AppX package from those files on disk. Finally, the tool can be used to create a trusted certificate on your computer to sign the new AppX pacakge. With the signed AppX package, the CLI can also automatically install the package on your machine.

## Configuration
:bulb: The first time you run this tool, it needs to know some settings. It will ask you only once and store your answers in your profile folder in a `.electron-windows-store` file. You can also provide these values as a parameter when running the CLI.

```json
{
  "publisher": "CN=developmentca",
  "windowsKit": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\x64",
  "devCert": "C:\\Tools\\DesktopConverter\\Certs\\devcert.pfx",
  "desktopConverter": "C:\\Tools\\DesktopConverter",
  "expandedBaseImage": "C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Images\\BaseImage-14316\\"
}
```

## Using all the fancy Windows APIs
You can pair up your Electron app with a little invisible UWP side-kick, enabling your Electron app to call all WinRT APIs. Check out [an example over here](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/electron-uwp-background).

## Devices
The compiled AppX package still contains a win32 executable - and will therefore not run on Xbox, HoloLens, or Phones.
